# Chatting-Application

This project is aimed to deliver a Desktop Chatting Application that is fully capable and ready to use for texting and chatting. 

Several features and protocols are taken into utter consideration while designing the system, which greatly enriched my knowledge and experience in the following concepts:
-Using Java Server Socket to establish connection-oriented communication using TCP protocol.
-Practising OOP concepts using Java.
-System design and implementation.
-GUI design.
